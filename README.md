# DATA PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE  

<h2 style="margin-left: 200px;"> ðŸ¤– Building Spotify  Data Pipeline ðŸ¤– </h2>
<img src='./spotify_arch.png'>
<h4></b>In this project, I have build an ETL(extract,Transform,Load) pipeline using the spotify API on local machine. The Pipeline will retrive data from the Spotify API, Tranform it to a desired format, and load it into an Mongodb database. 
  For user authentication I have used flask python framework only for one time authorisation.</h4>

<p> If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to do so using their Spotify credentials. When the user is logged in, they are asked to authorize access to the data sets or features defined in the scopes.</p>
